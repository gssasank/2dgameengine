# 2D Game Engine
A fully-functional 2D Game Engine

### Usage On OSX - Apple Silicon

Use homebrew to install Lua, DL2, SDL2_Mixer, SDL2_TTF, and SDL2_Image.

Make sure you're on Lua version 5.4.7, if not you'll have to update the header files in the libs directory.

In theory, there should be any issues running this project on Linux.
